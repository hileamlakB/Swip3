# Swip3
__Your Web3 credit card__. Swip3 is a lending protocol that allows users to take out lines of credit and pay with leverage directly on DApps.



## Introduction

E-commerce microtransactions of goods and services are moving onto Web3. Many functions of web2 finance are replicated to keep up with this demand. 

DeFi and payments are fragmented. Buyers pay for everything out of pocket by connecting their wallets directly to DApps, essentially paying for everything using your Web3 debit card. This leaves payments vulnerable to security risks and limits ability for per-payment leverage.

Security, leverage, and convenience can lower the activation energy for crypto payment transactions, ushering in greater adoption in the DeFi space.

At the intersection of growing lending and payment services is Swip3. We are your web3 credit card, providing per-payment loans in the palm of your hands. With our extension and developer API, users can easily leverage crypto and pay directly on DApps with their Swip3 cards.


## How Does it Work

__Never connect your wallet to DApp again:__

* We abstract DeFi lending and break it down to use for payments. Based on collateral, we provide a credit limit contract. This allows users to:
    * Leverage payments and keep exposure to assets
    * Harness security for flagged sites and scams
    * Get cash back for payments using yield farming
    * Use DApp native execution
    * Build a web3 credit score

## Swipes Suite of Products

* Swip3 Extension — users can create line of credit contract and access their Swip3 card directly on DApps with our extension.
* Developer API — calling just a single function, developers can integrate our API to allow credit payments on their DApps.
* Lending Pool SDK — lending pools can use Swip3 infrastructure to port new credit flows from per-payment loans from their lending pools with our SDK.

## Our Vision

Swip3 is extending access to per-payment leverage as the credit standard for users, DApps, and lending pools alike. By extending our developer API and partnering with existing pools on SDK integrations, we hope to build the infrastructure for a novel payment network.

Into the future, we are iterating quickly to include greater KYC, collateral yields, lending assets, and credit scoring — ultimately hoping to shift toward a lower friction uncollateralized model. Moreover, we are focusing especially on user-end security — providing greater fraud protection mechanisms and payment analytics.

We are blazing the trail for web3 credit and expanding adoption from our initial goal of 1000+ DApps to 1B+ users. DeFi is here to stay, Swip3 is bringing it to the masses.
